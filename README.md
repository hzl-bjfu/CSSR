# Class-Specific Semantic Reconstruction (CSSR)
## Project Overview
This repository contains the code for implementing a deep learning-based method for open-set cross-corpus bird vocalization recognition. The method addresses challenges in detecting unknown classes, extracting species-specific features, and achieving robust cross-corpus recognition by using a three-channel spectrogram, class-specific semantic reconstruction model, and Dual Strategy Coupling Scoring (DSCS) mechanism.
